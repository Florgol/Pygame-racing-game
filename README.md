# Pygame Racing Game
This game is the final project of the module 'Objektorientierte Skriptsprachen' (Object-oriented scripting languages), offered by the BHT (Berliner Hochschule f√ºr Technik).
The objective for this project was to explore the Python programming language and the Pygame framework.
This is a collaborative project between 2 students.

The resulting codebase is rough around the edges, as there is opportunity for efficiency optimizations and refactoring. Given more time, this would have been a priority.

You can play the game by downloading and executing the 'main.exe' file in the 'dist' folder.
