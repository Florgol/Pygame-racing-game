# Pygame Racing Game
This game is the final project of the module "Objektorientierte Skriptsprachen" (Object-oriented scripting languages), offered by the BHT (Berliner Hochschule f√ºr Technik).
The objective for this project was to explore the Python programming language and the Pygame framework.
This is a collaborative project between 2 students.

The resulting codebase is rough around the edges, as there is opportunity for refactoring and optimization of algorithms.
Given more time, this would have been a priority.

Feel free play the resulting game. You can do so by simply downloading and executing the main.exe file.
